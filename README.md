Just walked out of O'Dessa — my head still buzzing like I sat inside a washing machine on spin cycle but sans the clean clothes. What did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩?! The popcorn lodged in my teeth feels like a weird metaphor for how the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 stuck fragments of images in my brain. Is this what dreaming feels like for computers?

The noise, so much noise. Theater was like a chaos factory, feet shuffling, someone coughing like they've swallowed a trumpet. And the   itself — a vibrant canvas got torn apart and reassembled by a hyperactive toddler with a glue stick. Color and madness. There's a scene with a ferris wheel, or maybe it was a lighthouse? Could almost smell the sea, or was it the guy next to me with fish-flavored popcorn?

> My back aches like I danced with the idea of comfort and it rejected me, left me sitting in those unforgiving theater seats. But O'Dessa… yeah, it wrapped its chaotic fingers around my brain and didn't let go. How does one even begin critiquing something that's like if Picasso painted with emotions? Give it all the stars, or none, it's some kind of masterpiece or disaster in equal measures.

Oh! Kinda forgot someone asked if they should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   — absolutely both. You need the chaos swirling in your living room too. Spread it like jam over toast.

Weaving in and out, the characters like flickering neon signs of existential crisis. I could swear at one point I heard someone screaming for their lost cat, but maybe it was an allegory? Or just Jeff from Row C finally snapped. The whole thing feels like the taste of metal and cotton candy blended at top speed.

Anyway, still trying to figure out if my thoughts formed coherent sentences or just morphed into a bowl of spaghetti. Still tasting the echoes of that soundtrack that felt like a robot's heartbeat. Did any of this make sense? Who knows, but O'Dessa did something to me.
